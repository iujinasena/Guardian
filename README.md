# Guardian
An IoT based mini weather station

A DHT11 sensor and a BMP280 sensor were used to measure temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure and altitude. These measurements were sent to AWS IoT Core. Using Amazon Timestream, the collected data were stored in a time series database. Finally, real-time data was visualized using a Grafana dashboard.

Used Tools and Technologies : Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, Python, AWS IoT Core, Amazon Timestream, Grafana
